Creating and structuring of menus have always been a real challenge for online shop owners. They may have hundreds or even thousands of items in their shops â€“ and all these items have to be logically organized in certain menu categories. Otherwise their customers will not be able to find products they are looking for in a timely and easy way. <br>
